Hi there! My name is Petrus van Jaarsveld, although my friends call me Ruan. 

I'm a fresh software developer, still busy with my CS degree, and I've made this repo to have a controlled space to share my progress as I work on projects 
for some of the extracurricular courses I've been doing. In particular, this one is for the first stage of a C# course I'm working on.

Here you'll be able to see the exercises and tasks get posted as I work on them. Hopefully to serve as a bit of an organised portfolio of sorts, 
as well as doing me the added favor of organising these projects neatly and backing them up online!
